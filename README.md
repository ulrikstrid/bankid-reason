## Contributing

You need Esy, you can install the beta using [npm][]:

    % npm install -g esy@latest

Then you can install the project dependencies using:

    % esy install

Then build the project dependencies along with the project itself:

    % esy build

Now you can run your editor within the environment (which also includes merlin):

    % esy $EDITOR
    % esy vim

After you make some changes to source code, you can re-run project's build
using:

    % esy build

And test compiled executable (runs `scripts.tests` specified in
`package.json`):

    % esy test

Shell into environment:

    % esy shell

## Create Prebuilt Release:

`esy` allows creating prebuilt binary packages for your current platform, with
no dependencies.

    % esy npm-release
    % cd _release
    % npm publish
